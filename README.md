> **Intelligent undo for Claude Code sessions** - Revert individual operations with cascading safety and detailed previews.

ccundo seamlessly integrates with Claude Code to provide granular undo and redo functionality. It reads directly from Claude Code's session files to track file operations and allows you to selectively revert or restore changes with full preview and cascading safety.

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Detection** - Reads directly from Claude Code session files
- **Detailed Previews** - See exactly what will be changed before undoing/redoing
- **Cascading Undo/Redo** - Maintains project consistency by undoing/redoing dependent operations
- **Complete Redo System** - Reverse any undo operation with full cascading support
- **Multi-language** - Supports English, Japanese (日本語), Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia), and more
- **Smart Operation Tracking** - Tracks file edits, creations, deletions, renames, and bash commands
- **Safe Backups** - Creates backups before making changes
- **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with Claude Code

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g ccundo
```

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to a directory where you've used Claude Code
2. List recent operations:
   ```bash
   ccundo list
   ```
3. Preview what would be undone:
   ```bash
   ccundo preview
   ```
4. Undo operations with confirmation:
   ```bash
   ccundo undo
   ```
5. Redo previously undone operations:
   ```bash
   ccundo redo
   ```

## Usage

### List Operations

View all operations from your current Claude Code session:

```bash
ccundo list                    # Show recent operations
ccundo list --all             # Include already undone operations
```

**Example output:**
```
Operations from Claude Code session:

1. [ACTIVE] file_edit - 2m ago
   ID: toolu_01XYZ...
   File: /project/src/app.js

2. [ACTIVE] file_create - 5m ago
   ID: toolu_01ABC...
   File: /project/src/utils.js

3. [ACTIVE] bash_command - 7m ago
   ID: toolu_01DEF...
   Command: npm install express
```

### Preview Changes

See exactly what will be undone without making any changes:

```bash
ccundo preview                 # Interactive selection
ccundo preview <operation-id>  # Preview specific operation
```

**Preview shows:**
- File diffs for edits (- current content, + original content)
- Content that will be restored for deleted files  
- Files that will be deleted for created files
- Bash commands that require manual intervention

### Undo Operations

Safely revert operations with detailed confirmation:

```bash
ccundo undo                    # Interactive selection with preview
ccundo undo <operation-id>     # Undo specific operation
ccundo undo --yes             # Skip confirmation prompts
```

**Cascading Undo:** When you select an operation to undo, ccundo will also undo ALL operations that came after it. This ensures your project remains in a consistent state.

### Redo Operations

Restore previously undone operations with the same safety and preview features:

```bash
ccundo redo                    # Interactive selection of undone operations
ccundo redo <operation-id>     # Redo specific operation
ccundo redo --yes             # Skip confirmation prompts
```

**Cascading Redo:** When you select an operation to redo, ccundo will also redo ALL undone operations that came before it. This maintains the same consistency guarantees as undo operations.

### Session Management

Work with multiple Claude Code sessions:

```bash
ccundo sessions              # List all sessions across projects
ccundo session <session-id>  # Switch to specific session
```

### Language Support

ccundo supports multiple languages with persistent preferences:

```bash
ccundo language              # Show current language and options
ccundo language en           # Switch to English
ccundo language ja           # Switch to Japanese (日本語)
ccundo language id           # Switch to Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)
ccundo language fr           # Switch to French (Français)
ccundo language es           # Switch to Spanish (Español)
ccundo language de           # Switch to German (Deutsch)
```

**Supported Languages:**
- 🇺🇸 English (`en`) - Default
- 🇯🇵 Japanese (`ja`) - 日本語フルサポート
- 🇮🇩 Indonesian (`id`) - Bahasa Indonesia
- 🇫🇷 French (`fr`) - Français
- 🇪🇸 Spanish (`es`) - Español
- 🇩🇪 German (`de`) - Deutsch

## How It Works

ccundo automatically integrates with Claude Code by:

1. **Reading Session Files** - Parses `.jsonl` files in `~/.claude/projects/`
2. **Extracting Operations** - Identifies file operations and bash commands from tool usage
3. **Tracking Dependencies** - Understands operation ordering for safe cascading undo
4. **Creating Backups** - Saves current state before making changes to `~/.ccundo/backups/`
5. **Maintaining State** - Stores undo history and language preferences in `~/.ccundo/`

## Supported Operations

| Operation Type | Description | Undo Action | Redo Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **File Create** | Files created by Claude | Delete file (with backup) | Recreate file with original content |
| **File Edit** | File content modifications | Revert to original content | Re-apply the edit changes |
| **File Delete** | Files deleted by Claude | Restore file content | Delete file again (with backup) |
| **File Rename** | File/directory renames | Rename back to original | Apply rename again |
| **Directory Create** | Directory creation | Remove directory | Recreate directory |
| **Directory Delete** | Directory removal | Recreate directory | Remove directory again |
| **Bash Command** | Shell commands | Manual intervention required | Manual intervention required |

## Examples

### Undoing Recent File Changes

```bash
$ ccundo list
Operations from Claude Code session:

1. [ACTIVE] file_edit - 30s ago
   ID: toolu_01XYZ123
   File: /project/src/app.js

$ ccundo preview
📋 Preview: Would undo 1 operation(s):

1. file_edit - 30s ago
   Will revert file: /project/src/app.js
   
   - const newFeature = true;
   + const newFeature = false;
     console.log('App started');

$ ccundo undo --yes
✓ File reverted: /project/src/app.js
  Backup saved to: ~/.ccundo/backups/toolu_01XYZ123-current

Completed: 1 successful, 0 failed
```

### Cascading Undo Example

```bash
$ ccundo preview
⚠️  Cascading undo: Selecting an operation will undo it and ALL operations that came after it.

? Select operation to preview:
❯ file_create - 1m ago (+ 2 more would be undone)
  file_edit - 2m ago (+ 1 more would be undone)  
  bash_command - 5m ago

📋 Preview: Would undo 3 operation(s):

1. file_create - 1m ago
   Will delete file: /project/new-feature.js

2. file_edit - 2m ago  
   Will revert file: /project/app.js

3. bash_command - 5m ago
   Cannot auto-undo bash command: npm install new-package
   Manual intervention required
```

### Redoing Undone Operations

```bash
$ ccundo undo
# ... undo some operations ...

$ ccundo redo
⚠️  Cascading redo: Selecting an operation will redo it and ALL undone operations that came before it.

? Select operation to redo:
❯ file_edit - 2m ago (+ 1 more will be redone)
  file_create - 5m ago

$ ccundo redo --yes
✓ File edit redone: /project/src/app.js
  Backup saved to: ~/.ccundo/backups/toolu_01XYZ123-redo
✓ File recreated: /project/new-feature.js

Completed: 2 successful, 0 failed
```
